Most of the files in this repo are stand-alone, meaning they all have their own main function, usually consisting of a series of unit tests. I try to add lots of comments so students can understand what's happening step by step. 

If I've included an implementation in this repo, it has passed all of my unit tests. However, no one is immune to bugs. If you notice a bug, please document it using the issues tab, or fix it and send me a pull request.
